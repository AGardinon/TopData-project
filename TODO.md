# Molecular Systems:

* beta-hairpine peptide (avaliable through SI in PAMM paper)
* dialanine and/or trialanine peptides
* sample fibers

# Objective

Classify different molecular structure by using persistent homology 
and compare the results with other descriptors.

# Motivation

Paper on protein
